# MAGIC mentoring project
In this project I learned how to use html, CSS, and Javascript. I made a website to put my photos and share them with friends and family.
I really enjoyed learning to code over this school year I think that it is very helpful for me to get a good understanding of the codes I learned, and I also enjoyed debugging code with my mentor and figuring out how to fix things that neither of us knew. This year I made a website using html, Css, and Javascript. I at the time was learning about html and Css in school, but this program helped me to dig deeper into the coding process and really think about what I was doing. Javascript was difficult at first, but then got easier and easier as time went on. I did attempt at learning React, but I could not undersatnd how to code it and I found no way to put it in my website.
